<br>Shreya Jain is an economics major and political science minor at the University of California, Riverside. With a keen analytical mind and a passion for policy, Shreyaâ€™s academic pursuits uniquely position her to bridge the worlds of economic theory and political strategy. Her coursework in economics has honed her ability to dissect complex data, analyze trends, and apply quantitative methods to real-world challenges. Meanwhile, her political science minor enriches her understanding of the regulatory and institutional frameworks that shape economic policy, sparking her interest in issues at the intersection of public policy, economic decision-making, and social change.

<br>
Through her active involvement in the Highlander Economics Club, Shreya demonstrated her skills in economic analysis by participating in the Federal Reserve Challenge. Representing UCR, she collaborated with her team to pitch monetary policy suggestions that addressed current economic challenges, impressing the panel with her thorough understanding of macroeconomic indicators. This experience underscored her belief that economic decisions must incorporate political realities and work toward sustainable, equitable outcomes.


</p>
As a research assistant in UCRâ€™s Behavioral Economics and Decision-Making Lab, Shreya has contributed to innovative research projects exploring how psychological factors influence economic choices. Her work has even earned her acknowledgment in a published research paper, a testament to her commitment to evidence-based approaches in behavioral economics. Here, she applies both her technical skills in economic modeling and her understanding of human behavior, aiming to create policies that reflect real-world motivations and constraints. Beyond campus, Shreya recently competed in a social business challenge where she pitched business solutions to Silicon Valley mentors and a panel of judges. The competition gave her invaluable experience in presenting her ideas and devising scalable, market-oriented solutions with social impact. This blend of economics, business acumen, and social responsibility continues to inform her ambitions, as she aims to develop policies and innovations that benefit communities sustainably. Her career interests extend into the healthcare sector, and she has been exploring opportunities in this field through meetings with UCR faculty, including Professor Kou. Their conversations on medicinal research and its policy implications have motivated Shreya to pursue shadowing opportunities at City of Hope, where she will observe the responsibilities involved in a physician-researcher career. This experience will deepen her understanding of how economic principles can apply to healthcare and medical research, further broadening her interdisciplinary perspective. Shreya is currently working on an essay about climate change, a topic where her dual interests in economics and political science converge. She explores how economic policies can drive environmental sustainability, integrating her understanding of markets, policy frameworks, and social change. By tackling issues such as climate policy and healthcare access, Shreya is determined to bring her expertise to fields where analytical rigor and policy knowledge are crucial. She aspires to leverage her interdisciplinary background in both economics and political science to create policies that tackle pressing societal issues and leave a positive, lasting impact.        </p>
